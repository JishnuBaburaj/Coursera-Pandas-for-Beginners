# Coursera- Pandas Python Library for Beginners in Data Science

## Check out the project here: https://coursera.org/share/706f9d4519678be78f872b7630d192b7

This guided project is for absolute beginners in data science who want to learn about the features in pandas, one of the most important python libraries for data analysis.

By the end of this project, you will master the basics of pandas. You will be able to gain insight into the data, clean it, and do basic preprocessing to get the most value out of your data.

This project provides plenty of challenges with solutions to encourage you to practice using pandas.

In a video that plays in a split-screen with your work area, your instructor will walk you through these steps:

1) Three methods of creating a series.

2) Two methods of creating data frames.

3) Importing/exporting different types of data files and viewing rows.

4) Get a summary of the data & view column names and data types.

5) Calculate mean & cumulative sum. Determine minimum & maximum values.

6) String operations such as converting to uppercase letters , lowercase letters, swap case, finding the length of a string, splitting strings and detecting unique values.

7) Repeating strings.
